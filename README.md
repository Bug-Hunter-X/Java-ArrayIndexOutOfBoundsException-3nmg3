# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `UncommonBug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range. The `UncommonBugSolution.java` shows the corrected code.  This is a simple example, but the same principle applies to more complex scenarios where array indices are calculated dynamically.

This example highlights the importance of careful index checking when working with arrays in Java to prevent runtime exceptions and ensure program stability.
